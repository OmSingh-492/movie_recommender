To execute the website:
/admin: Admin page on the Django Server. Use user_id and Password to login.
/movierecommender: The actual webpage containing the movie recommendations.

Once a movie has been watched, go to the admin webpage to set its watched=True. Then, run the command:
python manage.py make_recommendations
from the Terminal. This runs the Jaccard Algorithm on the remaining unwatched movies, from the IMDB database.
Then, open the webpage again to get the new recommendations based on the watched history.
